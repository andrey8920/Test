We may think we know what nutrition is, but do we know why it&#8217;s important and what the difference is between nutrition and good nutrition?</p> <p> You are what you eat. It&#8217;s as simple as that. No matter how hard you try, a bad diet can&#8217;t be ignored. Our bodies are complex and they need a complex set of nutrients to function. So making sure we give our bodies the right nutrition is important. But what really is the right nutrition? And why is it so important?</p> <h2> What Is Nutrition?</h2> <p> The food and drink that you consume contain nutrients that fuel your body. They affect our metabolism, digestion, immunity, growth, and even mental well-being. Essentially, they tell our bodies on what to do and how to function. &#8216;Nutrition&#8217; is directly related to these nutrients. It is either the consumption or study of these nutrients in food. It&#8217;s about what we eat and drink to fuel our body. Simple!</p> <h2> What Is GOOD Nutrition?</h2> <p> It is all about eating the right balance of these nutrients. Getting the right nutrients in the right amounts can have a positive effect on your health. But good nutrition can be slightly different from person to person. It all depends on our height, weight, and activity level.</p> <p> We can assess our nutrition by monitoring our nutrient intake against the  RDAs (recommended daily allowance) . It&#8217;s quite easy nowadays with apps, like MyFitnessPal, that do the hard work for you. They count the carbs, fat, proteins, vitamins, and minerals that we eat to make sure that we get the right nutrition. It calculates the amounts you need based on your height, weight, activity level, and national RDAs. By understanding a little more about the nutrients our bodies need, we can alter what we eat to improve our nutrition.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <h2> What Nutrients Do We Need?</h2> <p> Although good nutrition can vary between people, there are some common essential nutrients.</p> <h2> Vitamins</h2> <p> These are essential nutrients that our body can&#8217;t produce.</p> <p> Nutrition </p> <h4> Why Are Vitamins Important? </h4> <p> </p> <p> <span> 2018-01-26 09:14:43</span> &bull; By Roxanne Griggs </p> <h2> Supplements And Minerals</h2> <p> Supplementing your diet with missing minerals can help with health concerns.</p> <p> Nutrition </p> <h4> What Are Supplements And Who Needs Them? </h4> <p> </p> <p> <span> 2018-01-26 11:52:31</span> &bull; By Roxanne Griggs </p> <h2> Proteins</h2> <p> Proteins are made up of amino acids, which our cells need to function.</p> <p> Nutrition </p> <h4> What Is Protein Powder Good For? </h4> <p> </p> <p> <span> 2018-01-26 16:33:51</span> &bull; By Roxanne Griggs </p> <p> We need all three of these nutrients (and more) to keep our bodies healthy. Neither one is more important than the other.</p> <p> </p> <h2> Why Is Good Nutrition Important?</h2> <p> Because good nutrition gives our bodies everything it needs in the right amounts, it keeps us healthy. It means that we have everything we need to function at our best. This reduces our risk of illness and injury because our body has the right nutrients to repair, restore, and protect.</p> <p> </p> <p> Infographic from Unity Point Health </p> <h2> Do We Need Nutritional Supplements?</h2> <p> Good nutrition is important to our general health and wellbeing. It can affect us physically and mentally throughout our lives. Eating a balanced diet with exercise is a big part of having good nutrition. The addition of supplements to our diets, however, may help us to control our nutritional intake a little better. They can help us get enough of certain nutrients that we may lack in our diet.</p> <p> It&#8217;s important not to get too much of certain nutrients, however. Monitoring your intake is important whether using supplements or not!</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <h4> Share this page</h4> <span> <span> Share this page on Twitter</span> </span> <span> <span> Share this page on Facebook</span> </span> <span> <span> Pin this page on Pinterest</span> </span> <span> <span> Share this page via WhatsApp</span> </span> <span> <span> Share this page by Email</span> </span> <h4> Roxanne Griggs </h4> <span> Public Health Nutritionist (ANutr)</span> <p> Qualified, Public Health Nutritionist (ANutr).</p> <h3> Related Articles</h3> Health <h4> The Best Black Friday Deals </h4> <p> <span> </span> • By Adam Barrett </p> Health <h4> An Interview with Dean Stott </h4> <p> <span> </span> • By Alicia Brittle </p> Recipes <h4> Easy Healthy Recipes: Your Complete Cookbook </h4> <p> <span> </span> • By Roxanne Griggs </p> Health <h4> The Benefits Of CLA </h4> <p> <span> </span> • By Sophie Angell </p> Health <h4> Vitamins For Families with Haliborange and Seven Seas </h4> <p> <span> </span> • By Sophie Angell </p> Nutrition <h4> The Best Vitamins For Beards </h4> <p> <span> </span> • By Sophie Angell </p> Beauty <h4> The Best Vitamins For Hair, Skin, And Nails </h4> <p> <span> </span> • By Roxanne Griggs </p> Nutrition <h4> Nutrition For Veggies: The Low Down </h4> <p> <span> </span> • By Amy Brawn </p> <span> Close product overlay</span> <span> </span> <p> <span> </span> </p> <p> </p> Buy now Description <p> </p> Sign up to our emails for the latest exclusive discounts and deals Connect with us <span> Facebook</span> <span> Twitter</span> <span> Instagram</span> <span> <span> Help & Information </span> </span> <span> </span> Contact Us <span> </span> Help Centre <span> </span> Returns <span> </span> UK Delivery <span> </span> International Delivery <span> <span> Our Range </span> </span> <span> <span> Our Range </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> </span> Best Sellers New In Vitamins Minerals <span> <span> Company Information </span> </span> <span> <span> Company Information </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> </span> About Us Privacy Policy Terms & Conditions Modern Slavery COVID-19 Affiliate Partnerships Trade Partnerships <span> <span> Loyalty & Rewards </span> </span> <span> <span> Loyalty & Rewards </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> </span> Voucher Codes Refer a Friend Student Discounts <p> 2020 © The Hut.com Ltd.</p> Pay securely with <span> Close step by step overlay</span> <span> </span> <span> Display the next step by step overlay image</span> <span> </span> <span> Display the previous step by step overlay image</span> <span> </span>
