They opened Nutrition Naturally in 1979. As new immigrants to this country, they lived and worked in the store until the store became a well-known destination in Atlanta to find healthy products and was very successful, and began to expand.</p> <p> <span> ​</span> </p> <p> Good Nutrition itself was conceived and opened in Norcross in 1996 with the addition of additional partners. The store in Norcross moved into a 10,000 square foot building next door, not only offering the best prices on vitamins and supplements, but the largest selection of products for every need in town. Soon all the stores became Good Nutrition.</p> <p> <span> ​</span> </p> <p> As awareness grew, there was a need to expand the business to additional locations. Now, Good Nutrition is the largest, independent group of natural product stores in the southeast (excluding Florida). Our service to the natural products industry and to the people of Atlanta was recognized nationally in 2014 when Good Nutrition was honored to be named "Retailer of the Year" by Vitamin Retailer magazine, a highly respected publication for the industry.</p> <p> </p> <p> <span> © 2018 by Good Nutrition.
