Such a diet contributes to some of the leading causes of death and increases the risk of numerous diseases 5 , including:</p> heart disease; diabetes; obesity; high blood pressure; stroke; osteoporosis; 6  and cancers , including cervical, colon, gallbladder, kidney, liver, ovarian, uterine, and postmenopausal breast cancers; leukemia; and esophageal cancer (after researchers took smoking into account). 7 <h3> <strong> Leading Causes of Death (2012) 7 </strong> </h3> <strong> 1. Heart Disease</strong> 599,711 <strong> 2. Cancer</strong> 582,623 3. Chronic lower respiratory disease 143,489 <strong> 4. Cerebrovascular disease (stroke and related conditions)</strong> 128,546 5.

Intentional self-harm (suicide) 40,600 <p> *Diseases to which poor diet contributes are in bold</p> <h2> Unhealthy eating habits and inactivity affect quality of life and cause disabilities</h2> <p> Few recognize that unhealthy diet is a leading cause of disability. Yet unhealthy eating habits and physical inactivity are leading causes of loss of independence:</p> Diabetes is a leading cause of blindness and amputations . Roughly 73,000 people have lower-limb amputations each year due to diabetes. 8 Bone injuries due to osteoporosis are most likely to occur in the hips, spine, and wrist. Even just a slight fracture in these areas can result in loss of independence. Twenty percent of seniors who break their hip die within just <strong> one year</strong> . Those who survive often require long-term (nursing home) care . 8, 9 Heart attack or stroke can result in difficulty with everyday activities—such as walking, bathing, or getting into or out of bed—or cognitive impairment. 10 <h3> <strong> Number of Americans Living with Diseases Related to Diet and Inactivity</strong>  </h3> Obesity 11 78,100,000 High Blood Pressure 12 66,900,000 Diabetes 13 29,100,000 Heart disease 14 26,600,000 Cancer 14 20,073,000 Osteoporosis 15 9,900,000 Stroke 14 6,400,000 <h2> Obesity rates are skyrocketing</h2> <p> Over two-thirds (67.5%) of American adults are overweight or obese . 2 </p> <p> Obesity rates in children have tripled over the last three decades, and one in three children and adolescents 2-19 years old is overweight or obese. 4, 16 </p> <p> Read more about how public policies could help reduce obesity. </p> <h2> It's expensive to ignore prevention</h2> <h3> Costs of Diseases Associated with Diet and Inactivity * </h3> Diabetes 8 $245 billion Cancer 18 $216.6 billion Coronary heart disease 9 $204.4 Billion Obesity 20 $190 Billion High blood pressure 19 $46.4 Billion Stroke 19 $36.5 Billion Osteoporosis 9 $19 Billion <p> * Estimates of annual direct + indirect costs for diseases overall (including portions caused by factors other than diet and physical inactivity), except for the figure for obesity, which is an estimate of direct (medical) costs only.</p> <p> Health care costs $8,900 per person per year. 21    According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), <strong> a 1% reduction in dietary health risks such as weight, blood pressure, glucose, and cholesterol risk factors would save $83 to $103 per person per year</strong>  in medical costs. 22 </p> <p> According to the Trust for America’s Health , if obesity trends were lowered by reducing the average adult body mass index (BMI) by only 5 percent, millions of Americans could be spared serious health problems, and our country could save $158 billion over the next 10 years. 23 </p> <h2> Current investments to promote healthy eating and physical activity are insufficient</h2> Funding for the  Division of Nutrition and Physical Activity  at CDC in FY15: $47.6 million. The Hershey Company spends 12 times that amount to promote its chocolate and other products ($562 million). 24 Amount food companies spend on advertising each year: $33 billion. 25, 26   Amount the food industry spends on advertising and promotions to children each year: $1.8 billion . 27 <p> <strong> References</strong> </p> https://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-compare/ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), NCHS Health E-Stat: Prevalence of Overweight, Obesity, and Extreme Obesity among Adults, United States, 1960-1962 through 2011-2012.
